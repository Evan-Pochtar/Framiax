# Framiax

Framiax is a desktop application designed for adding rich annotations to videos without relying on the cloud or online accounts. It lets you load a video file, pause or scrub to any point, and attach notes or drawings directly to specific time stamps. Annotations can be simple text comments or freehand sketches over the video frame.

Multiple people can review and contribute to the same video session in real time on a shared screen, making it useful for team feedback, training reviews, creative collaboration, or detailed analysis. When youâ€™re done, you can export the annotated video for archiving or later playback, with all notes and drawings preserved.

Everything runs locally on your machine. There is no login, no online storage, and no background services. Your files and annotations stay under your control. This project is in a very early stage and still in concurrent development.
